# No Ceilings Data Examples: Maternal Mortality

Within this directory you will find a very basic [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) sketch using the [maternal mortality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_mortality) indicator as an example of using this data resource.

The `index.html` page contains an early sketch used for the [maternal mortality story](http://noceilings.org/maternal-mortality/) on [noceilings.org](http://noceilings.org). It charts the regional data for maternal mortality over time, and displays the actual yearly values as well as the percent change between 1995 and 2010. The JavaScript file for this sketch is located at `js/sketch.js`.

The `embed.html` page exists as a way to embed this sketch into your own site.
