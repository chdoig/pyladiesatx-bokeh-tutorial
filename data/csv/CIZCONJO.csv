# Name: World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders,,,,,,,,,,,
# Definition: The World Press Freedom Index spotlights the negative impact of conflicts on freedom of information and its protagonists. The ranking of some countries has also been affected by a tendency to interpret national security needs in an overly broad and abusive manner to the detriment of the right to inform and be informed.,,,,,,,,,,,
