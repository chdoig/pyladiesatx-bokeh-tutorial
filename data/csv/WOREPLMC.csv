"# Definition: The definition will vary by source: for example, the UNECE’s definition includes women members of municipal councils and other local area governing bodies, while UNECLAC’s definition captures women elected to city councils. The EIU checked the other UN regional offices’ statistical websites, but they did not have any data for women in the judiciary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
