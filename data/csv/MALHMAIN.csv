"# Name: Malnutrition prevalence, height for age, stunting, male",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Definition: Prevalence of child malnutrition is the percentage of children under age 5 whose height for age (stunting) is more than two standard deviations below the median for the international reference population ages 0-59 months. For children up to two years old height is measured by recumbent length. For older children height is measured by stature while standing. The data are based on the WHO's new child growth standards released in 2006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
